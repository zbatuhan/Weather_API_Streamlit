# Weather API with Streamlit

You can use the following url for your own API.

URL: https://openweathermap.org/api

You can find all APIs provided by OpenWeather from this URL. In this project I used the "5 days / 3 Hour Forecast" option.

## Project Setup

#### First of all, you must replace the API KEY with your own key in the main_backend.py file.

```
pip install streamlit
pip install plotly.express
pip install requests
```
```
streamlit run main_gui.py
```

Thanks!
